# SmartSearch AI: Intelligent Data Extraction and Retrieval System

## Project Description
This project involves the development of an AI-driven application designed to facilitate intelligent data extraction and analysis using generative capabilities. The AI agent processes datasets and performs real-time web searches to extract specific information, structured and presented through an interactive dashboard.

## Key Features

1. **Dashboard for File Upload and Sheets Connection**: 
    - Users can upload CSV files or connect Google Sheets for automatic data input.
    - Offers a preview of the uploaded data and selection of the primary column for the search.

2. **Dynamic Query Input**:
    - Users define custom prompts with placeholders for personalized information retrieval.
    - Prompts dynamically adapt to each entity in the dataset.

3. **Automated Web Search and Retrieval**:
    - Executes web searches per user-defined parameters and accumulates search results efficiently.
    - Employs web scraping technologies like SerpAPI ensuring scalability and compliance with API limits.

4. **Information Parsing Using LLM**:
    - Integrates a Language Learning Model (LLM) to parse and extract required data fields from search results.
    - Ensures accurate and context-aware data extraction.

5. **User-friendly Data Presentation**:
    - Extracted information displayed in a tabular format for ease of analysis.
    - Downloadable in CSV format or updatable to Google Sheets.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Streamlit for dashboard UI.
- **Data Handling**: Pandas for CSV processing, Google Sheets API for Sheets integration.
- **Web Search**: SerpAPI.
- **AI Models**: LLM like GroqAPI.
- **Backend**: Python for process orchestration.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application using `python steps.py`.
4. Access the dashboard via `http://localhost:port/` in your web browser.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement advanced error handling for API and data extraction processes.
- Explore additional interactive elements to expand data query capabilities.
- Continuous integration of additional APIs for improved data retrieval.

## Conclusion
This project exemplifies the integration of generative AI within data extraction and web search processes, emphasizing innovation in user applications and technical implementation.

## Project Status Update
I have not yet completed the "SmartSearch AI: Intelligent Data Extraction and Retrieval System" project due to ongoing college exams, which have required significant time and attention. However, I am committed to finishing the project soon. Thank you for your understanding and patience.
